# 🔬 My Personal Game Engine Journey (with Vulkan!)

> Just a humble playground where I tinker with code, graphics, and a lot of curiosity.

Hey there! 👋  
This is my **personal project**, built completely from scratch as I teach myself how game engines really work —  pure exploration and a love for how things function *under the hood*.

🎮 Ever played a first-person shooter or walked through a 3D world and wondered:
- *How is all of this even rendered?*
- *How do the CPU and GPU communicate?*
- *What makes a pixel appear right where it does?*

Well... me too. So here I am — diving into **Vulkan**, C++, and the math behind the magic. 🚀

This isn't meant to be a full engine (yet 😅), more like a lab for experimenting and learning:
- Render loops? Trying them out.
- Memory management? Struggling, but learning.
- Shaders? Writing and breaking them.
- Crashes? Oh, plenty.

💡 The goal? Understanding *why* things work, not just *how* to copy them.

So yeah, it's not much right now — but it's honest, and it's mine. ❤️  
If you're into low-level graphics, Vulkan, and self-taught madness — feel free to watch, clone, or just nod in approval.
